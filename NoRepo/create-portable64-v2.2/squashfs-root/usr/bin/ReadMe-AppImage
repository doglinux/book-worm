version 2.0, improvements for Portablelinuxapps mode and Chroot mode.
Fixed a bad bug for the Chroot mode (was using too high CPU)

Info for 'Chroot Mode':
Note: when logged in as regular user, having the program "linux-user-chroot" installed is recommended.
Copy it (as root) from <this directory>/usr/bin to PATH , e.g. /usr/local/bin, it needs to have the setuid bit and should be owned by root.
To check, run in terminal:   ls -l /usr/local/bin/linux-user-chroot, it should be like this:
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root ..... .......... ......... 
In case this has changed (e.g. caused by copying), running this program as regular user, linux-user-chroot doesn't work anymore; to solve it:  Run this command from terminal as root:

chown root:root /usr/local/bin/linux-user-chroot && chmod 6755 /usr/local/bin/linux-user-chroot

Then it will be automagically detected and used when running the appimage

The "abs2rel" script in this directory can be used to convert all symlinks, pointing to an absulute path, to relative paths.
Run it from a terminal opened in this directory.
Use it only as last resort if the program doesn't run , it may help in some cases.
